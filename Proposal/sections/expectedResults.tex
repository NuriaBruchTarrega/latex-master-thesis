\section{Expected results of the project} \label{section:expectedResults}
Currently, there are three expected results of this project:

\paragraph{Theoretical description of the set of metrics:}
The first result is the description of a set of metrics to be used to answer the research questions. These are the coupling metrics to calculate the degree of dependency between a project and its libraries, as well as the estimation of effort needed to replace the libraries.
Each metric will include a formal definition as well as a set of validation criteria that these metrics will have to fulfill to be considered valid.

\paragraph{Implementation of the proof-of-concept (PoC):}
The second result will be the software implementation of the previously created theoretical model.
This PoC will be meant to be used as a prototype to calculate the metrics proposed, to use the results for the evaluation and validation of the metrics.

\paragraph{Validation of the metrics:}
Once the PoC is ready, the validation of the metrics will be conducted. There will be experiments for the coupling metrics, as well as case studies for the effort estimation.
The third result is expected to be a report with the conclusions of the validation, the theoretical and the empirical ones.
