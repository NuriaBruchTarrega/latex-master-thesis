\section{Problem statement}

\subsection{Context}
Nowadays, many open-source libraries are used by developers to be able to reuse the features that these libraries implement.
This implies that a significant number of projects depend on other open-source projects \cite{kula2014visualizing}. Maintaining these dependencies and managing the vulnerabilities or problems that these can cause is not a trivial task, and it is one of the problems that software engineering is trying to solve \cite{kula2014visualizing}.

Furthermore, it is a critical task. For example, some vulnerabilities can become security problems that can have a negative impact in terms of integrity, privacy or availability \cite{CVE-FAQ}. This may make it necessary to replace the library being used, to prevent these problems from spreading to the project.
Replacing a library dependency could be a very costly process. For instance, it could involve determining which modules of your project are affected, and which functionalities of the library are being used and need replacement. As well as which is the best way to replace them (i.e. using another library or developing them in-house).
In addition, similar problems may arise if a library becomes closed-source.

\blankl
Currently, most of the package management systems include dependency management, but these are only listing which dependencies exist in each project \cite{hejderup2018prazi}.
Therefore, a more detailed risk evaluation of the open-source dependencies is missing and could be useful for many projects.

This project is carried out in collaboration with the company \textit{Software Improvement Group (SIG)}, and it is motivated by the \textit{FASTEN} project \footnote{\url{https://www.fasten-project.eu/}}. The objective of this project is to improve the quality of open-source development environments to make them more secure and reliable. For this reason, the FASTEN project aims to analyze the software library dependencies that the projects have, in more detail. Some members of SIG are working in the FASTEN project since the goals of the project, are aligned with those of SIG. The good maintenance of the dependencies of a project is also part of the heath and security of software applications.

\subsection{Research questions} % Here, I still have to think about the terminology used, because I am not sure about this "software product" thing.
To tackle the issues described in the previous section, we specify the following research questions:

\blankl
\textbf{RQ1:} \textit{How can we measure the degree of source code dependency between two software products?}

In order to define an approach to answer this question and to divide the question in different parts or steps, we have defined the following subquestions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1.1:} \textit{What constitutes a dependency between two products?}

  One of the first steps to find a way to measure the degree of dependency, it is to determine what creates a dependency. The type of connection between the products and how to count them, among other characteristics.
  \blankl

  \item \textbf{RQ1.2:} \textit{Which metrics can be used to measure the dependency?}

  In this part of the research, we investigated which existing coupling metrics could be used to measure dependency between software products. We evaluated the metrics according to the characteristics defined in the previous subquestion, to select the ones applicable for our case. Also, in this part, it is defined how to adapt them to the new usage.
  \blankl

  \item \textbf{RQ1.3:} \textit{How can we calculate the metrics?}

  With a defined set of metrics to use, it is necessary to calculate them, to have some results to evaluate the metrics. In order to do so, we are going to use a call-level dependency graph, as will be explained later on.
  \blankl

  \item \textbf{RQ1.4:} \textit{Which is the meaning of the metrics in this scenario?}

  After calculating the metrics in a project, there is a number as a result. But what is the meaning of the number? What is the meaning of the metric? The idea is to define the meaning of the metric, so the number gives actionable information, which can be used to improve the state of the product.
  \blankl

  \item \textbf{RQ1.5:} \textit{How can we validate the proposed metrics?}

  Finally, with the results, and the definition of the metrics, we have validated them. There are two approaches to do so, the theoretical and the empirical. The metrics will be validated using both approaches, as extensibly as time permits.
\end{itemize}

\blankl
\textbf{RQ2:} \textit{How can we measure the effort required to replace the use of a library in a software product?}

This second question is in the case that a vulnerability is discovered in one of the dependencies of a software product, or a library becomes deprecated. In this case, it may be necessary to replace the dependency of the product. To do so, it could be useful to have an estimation of the effort needed to replace the library. To answer this question, we have defined the following subquestions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ2.1:} \textit{What do we consider effort, which is the definition?}

  There are many different definitions of effort in the literature. One of the most common ones is the man-hours per lines of code. In this case we are going to define which one is the effort that we want to measure in this research.
  \blankl

  \item \textbf{RQ2.2:} \textit{Which is the definition of replace the use of a library?}

  There are many different cases which could be defined as replacing a library. All the cases between adding a new dependency and removing an existing one. Therefore, we are going to specify the taxonomy used to describe the types of library replacement, and from those types, determine which are the studied ones, and which are not.
  \blankl

  \item \textbf{RQ2.3:} \textit{Which are the applicable methods to measure effort?}
  From all the methods and strategies to measure effort existing in the literature, we are going to chose which are the ones that measure the effort that we defined in RQ2.1, and are applicable to the specific situation defined in RQ2.2.
  \blankl

  \item \textbf{RQ2.4:} \textit{How can we validate the measurement of the effort?}
  Finally, as in RQ1.5, it is necessary to validate the method used to measure effort, both empirically and theorically. Therefore, we are going to validate that the formulas fulfill some defined properties. In addition, we are going to conduct some case studies from project in which a library has been replace, to contrast this with the estimation made with our model.
\end{itemize}

\blankl
\textbf{RQ3:} \textit{How can the degree of the dependency and the effort needed to replace a software product be aggregated?}

This last Research Question is meant to aggregate the research done in RQ1 and RQ2. However, this research question will only be answered in case time permits.

\subsection{Research method}
The main research method that is going to be employed during this project is \textit{Technical Action Research} (TAR) \cite{wieringa2012technical}.
This research method is artifact-based, which means that the first step is to produce the artifact meant to be used in certain situations envisioned by the researcher. The testing of this artifact, to see if it is effective in these situations, is done through a number of iterations. First, under ideal conditions, and then changing the experiments step by step to reach a real-world situation. These iterations, in the context of this project, are going to be limited due to the existing deadlines. However, there is the option of continuing with this part of the work in the future.

\blankl
In addition, the research will also include controlled experiments. These experiments will be conducted as the empirical part of the validation of the coupling metrics. Additionally, the empirical validation of the effort estimation is going to be achieved by the means of case studies. In these case studies, the estimated effort will be compared with the real effort that the change required.

\blankl
Some of the most difficult parts of this research are the validation and adaptation of the coupling metrics.
First, the validation since there is not a unique way to do it, but rather a wide variety of criteria and approaches. Therefore, conducting a complete validation is a complex task as it is not possible to validate every aspect of the metric.
In addition, even though the metrics that are going to be used to measure coupling between software products already exist, they are going to be adapted. These changes of the metrics could be complex for some of them. However, there are many metrics that could be used, and the ones that cannot be adapted could serve as an indication of the types of dependencies that could exist when adapting other metrics.

\blankl
After the formal definition and theoretical validation of the metrics for both, the coupling measurement and the estimation effort, to replace a library, a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) will be made. With this PoC, the metrics will be calculated for the projects given to the PoC. Once the PoC is ready, the empirical validation will be carried out for each of the metrics, by conducting controlled experiments and case studies as elaborated above.
The methodology for validating the metrics chosen during this research will be divided into two phases: a first phase of theoretical validation and a second one of empirical validation \cite{srinivasan2014software}.
