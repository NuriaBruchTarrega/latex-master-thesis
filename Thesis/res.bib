abstract = {The Maven Central Repository provides an extraordinary source of data to understand complex architecture and evolution phenomena among Java applications. As of September 6, 2018, this repository includes 2.8M artifacts (compiled piece of code implemented in a JVM-based language), each of which is characterized with metadata such as exact version, date of upload and list of dependencies towards other artifacts. Today, one who wants to analyze the complete ecosystem of Maven artifacts and their dependencies faces two key challenges: (i) this is a huge data set; and (ii) dependency relationships among artifacts are not modeled explicitly and cannot be queried. In this paper, we present the Maven Dependency Graph. This open source data set provides two contributions: a snapshot of the whole Maven Central taken on September 6, 2018, stored in a graph database in which we explicitly model all dependencies; an open source infrastructure to query this huge dataset.},

@article{Kula2017,
abstract = {Popular (re)use of third-party open-source software (OSS) is evidence of the impact of hosting repositories like maven on software development today. Updating libraries is crucial, with recent studies highlighting the associated vulnerabilities with aging OSS libraries. The decision to migrate to a newer library can range from trivial (security threat) to complex (assessment of work required to accommodate the changes). By leveraging the `wisdom of the software repository crowd' we propose a simple and efficient approach to recommending `consented' library updates. Our Software Universe Graph (SUG) models library dependency and update information mined from super repositories to provide different metrics and visualizations that aid in the update decision. To evaluate, we first constructed a SUG from 188,951 nodes of 6,374 maven unique artifacts. Then, we demonstrate how our metrics and visualizations are applied through real-world examples. As an extension, we show how the SUG can compare dependencies between different super repositories. From a sample of 100 GitHub applications, our method found that on average 79{\%} similar overlapping dependencies combinations exist between the maven and github super repository universes.},
